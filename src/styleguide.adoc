== Markup converstion

GITenberg books are generated from a canonical markup format.  That format is Asciidoc.  

TIP: You might ask why not markdown.html[Markdown]

== Target formats
The primary html output of GITenberg books is in https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/[HTMLBook] format.
Using HTMLBook allows us to write CSS for one book, and use it on any other book.

[line-through]*We package generated html as an epub, and convert that epub file to .mobi for kindle devices.*
