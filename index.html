      <p>Your head is not an artifact! Wouldn't that bring about chaos? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I'll alert the crew. How long can two people talk about nothing? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Well, that's certainly good to know. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Talk about going nowhere fast. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. What? We're not at all alike! We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I guess it's better to be lucky than good. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Your shields were failing, sir. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant?</p>
