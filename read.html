        <h3 class="mainhead" id="welcome">$ git commit Alice-in-Wonderland.txt -m "Down the Rabbit Hole..."</h3>

         <p><b>Project GITenberg</b> is a <b>Free and Open</b>, <b>Collaborative</b>, <b>Trackable</b> and <b>Scriptable</b> digital library. It leverages the power of the <b>Git</b> version control system and the collaborative potential of <b><a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a></b> to make books more open.</p> 
         <p>Currently there are <a href="http://github.com/GITenberg/">38772 books</a> in GITenberg.</p>


        <h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

        <p class ="subhead">-Free and Open</p>
        <p> Our mission is to curate a <b>free and open</b> library of books. All books are in the public domain and can be corrected, pulled, and forked for any purpose.</p>
        <p class ="subhead">-Collaborative</p>
        <p>Programmers already have a tried-and-true way to collaborate on projects, <b>Git.</b> <a href="http://Github.com">Github</a> allows this collaboration to be <b>open</b> and <b>social</b>, allowing anyone with a username to maintain our large collection of ebooks. </p>
        <p class ="subhead">-Trackable</p>
        <p>Leveraging the Git version control system, we can keep track of changes, track open issues with any book, and track contributions.</p>
        <p class ="subhead">-Scriptable</p>
        <p>Serving books the way we serve code has its benefits. We can use <b>Git</b> and the <b><a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">Github Api</a></b>, to do things like automatically generate epub and pdf files whenever there is a change stored in Git.</p>

        <h3 id="contributing">Interested in Contributing?</h3>
        <p><b>Awesome!</b> For now there are a few things you can do depending on your interest and skill level. Firstly, if you find an error or typo in any of the books, report it in the 'Issues' tab on that repo.  If you would like to offer changes: fork, edit and create a Pull Request. If you would like to make suggestions, help in another way, or would like to get more involved, you can join the project <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gitenberg-project">mailing list</a>.

        <h3 id="gutenberg">About <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg?</a></h3>
        <p>These books originate from the <b>fantastic</b> work of Project Gutenberg. Our goal is that changes here will eventually appear there.</p>
        <blockquote>Project Gutenberg (PG) is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to "encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks". It was founded in 1971 by Michael S. Hart and is the oldest digital library. Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of public domain books. The project tries to make these as free as possible, in long-lasting, open formats that can be used on almost any computer. As of July 2012, Project Gutenberg claimed over 40,000 items in its collection.
